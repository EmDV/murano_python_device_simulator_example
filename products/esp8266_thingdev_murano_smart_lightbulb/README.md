# Exosite Murano Example - ESP8266 Thing Dev Board as WiFi Smart Lightbulb

This example walks through setting up a ESP8266 Thing Dev Board to act as a Smart Lightbulb
with Murano.  Users can feel free to customize after walking through this guide as you'll have
created a full Product instance that supports a deployment of devices specific to that Product.
Product definition can be updated and more devices can be added.  After walking through these steps,
users will be interacting with live device data using a prototype developer dashboard tool.  
After this, users can go through the Murano Solution examples to deploy a Example consumer web application
that works with this product demo.

## Software Setup
### Setup Arduino IDE and Libraries
0. Install Arduino [arduino.cc](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
1. Install ESP8266 Thing Dev Board support using Arduino Board Manager - [ESP8266 Thing Dev Board Install Directions ](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/esp8266-thing-hookup-guide/installing-the-esp8266-arduino-addon)
2. Install Exosite Arduino Library - Use Arduino Library Manager, search for `Exosite`

   _More info: [Exosite Arduino Library Details](https://github.com/exosite-garage/arduino_exosite_library)_

3. Install [Adafruit DHT Library](https://github.com/adafruit/DHT-sensor-library) - You can use Arduino Library Manager, search for `DHT`
4. Install [DHT Sensor Library](https://github.com/adafruit/DHT-sensor-library) - You can use Arduino Library Manager, search for `DHT`

### NEW TO ARDUINO?
_Arduino is a powerful software platform for quickly building applications on embedded hardware.  Although typically easier than most any other software IDEs and compilers, it can still be a learning experience for new users. Once installed quickly with the necessary libraries, users will find they can customize and build applications in minutes.  Here are a few links to get an understanding of Arduino since this guide does not cover every concept of the Arduino IDE and hardware concepts (in this case the SparkFun ESP8266 Thing Dev Board) Note that Arduino supports a number of hardware platforms, not just Arduino branded boards themselves, like the ESP8266 Thing Dev Board._

### Set-up Murano Product
1. Create a Product
  ![create new](assets/add_new_product.png)
  ![create new window](assets/add_new_product_window.png)

  After creating a product, devices need two pieces of information to activate with the platform.  These are the Product ID when you create your product and a unique identifier serial number.  The Product ID can be found on the `Info` tab on the Product page.

  ![product id](assets/get_product_id.png)

  The Unique Identifier or Serial Number is device firmware specific.  In this situation, the Exosite Arduino library uses the device's pre-programmed MAC Address.  You'll need to get this from the debug serial output when you run the Arduino example code in a moment.

2. Set up the Product Definition
   If you did not use a template when creating the Product, go to the Definition Tab and set up your dataport resources as specified here.
   * alias: __temperature__, format: __float__
   * alias: __humidity__, format: __float__
   * alias: __uptime__, format: __integer__
   * alias: __state__, format: __integer__

   ![resources](assets/adding_resources.png)

 3. Set the default value for `state` to 0 so the device has a default value it reads to know to turn on or off the LED. Click on the `state` resource in the Definition tab and write a 0 to the value.

   _Note: We do not yet have the device's MAC address, so wait on adding the device._

### Create and Run the example application
__New to Arduino?__

1. Create a new Arduino Sketch.
2. Copy this examples .ino file's `raw` content into new Arduino Sketch
5. Edit WiFi configuration parameters for your local WiFi network (SSID and Password)
6. Edit Exosite Product ID from Murano
   ![sketch](assets/sketch_edit_parameters.png)

7. Make sure board is connected to your computer via USB port and select the correct Port from the Arudino Tools menu.
   ![port](assets/arduino_serial_port_selector.png)

8. Select the correct board before you compile your code from the Tools menu.
   ![board](assets/board_selection.png)

9. Click the Upload button which will first compile and then download to your plugged in board.
   ![upload](assets/compile_upload_button.png)

8. Open the Serial Monitor.  
   ![serial](assets/serial_monitor.png)

9. Copy Device Identifier (MAC Address) from the Serial Monitor Output.  
   ![compile download](assets/run_debug_get_unique_identifier.png)
   _(You can click the Autoscroll if the log window goes past the top)_

### Add Device to Murano Product
1. Add Device to Product in Murano using the Device Identifier (MAC Address)
  ![add device](assets/add_unique_device.png)
  ![not activated](assets/not_activated_devices.png)
2. If you have used this hardware before with Exosite's Library, restart your Device by either using the boards On/Off Switch or Uploading your Sketch again to the board.  
2. Verify Device Provisions using the Arduino Serial Output.
if previously used and may have a old CIK (private device API key) stored in it's non-volatile memory (EEPROM).
   ![activation log](assets/debug_output_activation_text.png)
3. View Device Resources (click on device)
   ![device resources](assets/device_resources_new_data.png)

### Run the Product Dashboard Developer Tool
1. On the Device page, click the 'Dashboard' tab - which is a link to the Murano Product Dashboard Developer Tool.  This opens a new browser tab.  
   ![dashboard link](assets/dashboard_link.png)
   ![dashboard empty](assets/dashboard_empty.png)
2. Add a pane, then add a widget to the pane.
  ![dashboard add widget](assets/dashboard_add_widget.png)
3. Interact with live data
